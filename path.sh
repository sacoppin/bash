#!/bin/bash

#  chmod u+x path.sh
#  ./path.sh
#Write a shell script receiving a path as argument, depending on if it's a file or a directory, display or list its content.
#You can complexify the script by only displaying file containing text (ex: .txt, .js) and returning an error for anything else (ex: .mp3, .pdf).

echo Where are we?
pwd
echo Ok what files do you have?
echo Give me path to files please.
